# Linear Regression and the Best-Fit Curve

Linear regression can be used to find the best-fit curve to a set of points in
the plane.

The present project aims to produce a PDF document, a C++ library, and a
command-line tool (whose source is C++).

The document describes
 - the mathematics of linear regression,
 - how to set up a linear regression in [Eigen 3][1]
 - how to use the present library, and
 - how to use the command-line tool.

At present, the document does a brief sketch of the mathematics and shows one
way to set up the linear regression in Eigen 3.

The library and executable are not written yet.
