# Building

In order to run make successfully, the build system must meet the following
criteria:
 - GNU make must be installed in the path.
 - A C++-11-capable compiler (such as g++-4.8 or later) must be installed in
   the path. (Or accessible by way of something like 'CXX=g++-4.8 make'.)
 - Transfig must be installed in the path.
   - This might be bundled with XFig in the operating system's package system.
   - Otherwise, look here: http://xfig.org/userman/installation.html
 - pdflatex must be installed in the path.
